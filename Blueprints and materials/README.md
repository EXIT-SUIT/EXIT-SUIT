EXIT SUIT
The EXIT SUIT is a full-body force-feedback navigation and performance suit for Virtual Reality. This repo contains our code so far for connecting the EXIT SUIT to Unity.

We are building a community of supporters to help us bring the EXIT SUIT to the public. We recognise it is an important step in the development of human/computer interface and virtual reality.
